# TradingCurrency

I'm assuming that a settlement date can occur on same date as instruction date.
I'm not taking hours in consideration
I'm taking in account known currencies. If any currency is not configured, I cannot be sure wich way to calculate the settlement date.
I'm taking in consideration that there's only two valid operations (buy and sell), represented by 'S' and 'B'.
